# **Algorithms**
## Goal - to exercise recursion by implementing some valuable algorithms

### 1. Merge Sort
`Worst Case Time Complexity - O(n log n)`

Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.
